# hello-world
My first github repository and tutorial.  I'm growing my language knowledge learning Python.  What an interesting meld of features from all over.  Regular expressions and whitespace usage as in Unix scripting and built in data structure objects; structures such as dictionaries (known as hash tables in the C world), lists and tuples that you write the C modules yourself. Nice.
